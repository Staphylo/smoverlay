Overall
-------

 - global performance improvement, especially in gui with setters

Core
----

 - allow option parser to be hookable by each main()
   BUG currently the gui config is not written out during creation
 - be able to load plugins outside the package following configuration paths
 - be able to notify a running process as a reloading mechanism
    - update/reload all plugins
    - update/relead every plugins
    - reload configuration

Gui
---

 - Fix the plugin size in QML (actually a hack by having QMonitor.pluginHeight)

 - Fix the exit segfault
 - Show exit button only for debugging (see configuration file)
 - Drag and drop to reorder plugins (saving layout imply rewriting configuration)
 - Disable updating/rendering when hidden
    - updating is disabled when overlay is hidden (cost of smoverlay.running?)
    - failed to freeze the gui so far
 - Signal are class signal and not object signal
 - Smoothing transitions from one value to an other
